    <h1><b></b>Che Ku Jafri's Family</h1>
    <p>
        Regardless of age, whether young or old, we respect and value others, and we should love one another.<br>
         Others, however, hold that if someone is near to us, such as a close friend or another relative, they may<br> also be considered family.In my opinion, family are consists of those who genuinely care about you and <br>
         want the best for you. Helpfulness, respect, health, honesty, and cooperation are among my core values<br>
         I am aware of and sensitive to those of my family. By being aware of one another's ideals, we can develop<br>
         respect and support for one another. people that want to accept you for who you are as a human being and <br>
         have open hearts. You can always count on your family in times of trouble or disaster. Family helps you<br>
         make wise judgements and re-establishes your connection to your values.

         <p>
            <br>
            <br>
            My family has been always by my side in ups and downs. They have taught me how to be a better person.<br>
            My family consists of six siblings and my parents.He has taught me the real meaning of strength. My siblings<br>
            are my best friends on whom I can always fall back on. They always cheers me up whenever I do not feel good. <br>
            My family is my power that keeps pushing me to achieve newer heights.
         </p>
         <p>
        
            <br>
            In short, I will forever be indebted to my family for all they have done for me. I cannot imagine my life without<br>
            them. They are my first teachers and my first friends.They are responsible for creating a safe and secure environment<br>
             for me at home. I can share everything with my family as they never judge one another. We believe in the power of love <br>
             above everything and that drives us to help each other to become better human beings.
